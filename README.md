# Assignment 5: Data Structures and Strings in Python

This repository contains the solutions for Module 6: Assignment 5. The project demonstrates the use of Python Dictionaries for data retrieval and Python Lists for slicing and manipulation.

## Files Included

1.  `task1_student_marks.py`: A script to look up student marks from a dictionary.
2.  `task2_list_slicing.py`: A script demonstrating list creation, slicing, and reversing.

## Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Student Marks Dictionary
**Description:**
This program stores student names and their corresponding marks in a dictionary. It prompts the user to input a name and retrieves the marks.
